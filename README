# MASA-OpenCL
MASA-OpenCl is a MASA (https://github.com/edanssandes/MASA-Core) extension to execute sequence comparison in OpenCL devices. It requires OpenCL v1.2, and it can be adjusted to be executed in CPU or GPU devices. Is was tested on Intel and AMD CPUs, AMD and NVidia GPUs.


# Deploy instructions
