CUDAlign is a software that is able to align DNA sequences of 
unrestricted size with the Smith-Waterman algorithm combined 
with Myers-Miller. It uses the NVIDIA CUDA platform for accelerating 
the computation time. It produces the optimal alignment of 
1 million base sequences in 45 seconds using a GTX 560 Ti. 
For chromosomes with 33 and 47 million base pairs, CUDAlign can 
produce the optimal alignment in less than 9 hours.
